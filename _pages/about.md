Hi, my names Qiping Pan. I am bred and born in China and now studying in U of M. My interests lie in Machine learning and web development skills. 

I am currently focusing on learning both the basics and state of art of deep learning. I am curious about the mathematical explanation for the architectures and how each model generalizes our world into sets of parameters. Deep learning has just started it's journey, but it has already succeeded in many areas, reaching an overwhelming high accuracy. I am very passionated to explore more about the theories and secrets behind the scene. When I have time, I enjoy reading publications, take courses on coursera and doing competitions on Kaggle.

Also I have learnt web development myself because many projects I involved requires human computer interaction and visualization. Developing a webpage is always an optimal way to achieve that. Different from the machine learning theories, I love web develop for its practical value. It is great to explore how the technology iterates. Those brilliant frameworks are always embedded with great ideas, either reduces the computation forces required or faciliates the develop experience. It is always valuable to learn the way they think. In 2021 summer I took an internship in TikTok as a web developer, where I learnt lots of fancy ideas that I believe to have changed my mindset.

That's so far I can tell about myself. If something interested you, don't hesitate to contact me by email.
