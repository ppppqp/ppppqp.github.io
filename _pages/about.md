Hi, my names Qiping Pan. I am bred and born in China and now studying in U of M. My interests lie in Machine learning and web development skills. 

This is the era of big data. I firmly believe that great models that solves our everyday problem must properly handle data. Therefore I have devoted much time in developing data mining skills. I am currently focusing on learning both the basics and state of art of [deep learning](https://panqiping.gitbook.io/deep-learning-bible-note/). I am curious about the mathematical explanation for the architectures and how each model generalizes our world into sets of parameters. However, deep learning is just one aspects of exploring patterns from data.

During my data mining adventure, I find that visualization plays a critical role in enhancing the intepretation. I began to learn [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) as the visualization tool for the data. As I dig deeper, it makes me also a self-taught web developer and successfully find a job intern in [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/). Developing a webpage is a convenient way to display data in customized way.

That's so far I can tell about myself. If something interests you, don't hesitate to contact me by email.
