Hi, my name's Qiping Pan. I was bred and born in China and now studying in Unversity of Michigan. My interests lie in computer system and machine learning.

This is the era of big data. I firmly believe that great models that solves our everyday problem must properly handle data. Therefore I have devoted much time in developing machine learning skills. I am currently focusing on learning both the basics and state of art of [deep learning](https://panqiping.gitbook.io/deep-learning-bible-note/). I am curious about the mathematical explanation for the architectures and how each model generalizes our world into sets of parameters. My perspective is that current machine learning techniques is far from AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Although AGI, being an romantic dream for human begins, is still inaccessible, the current machine learning techniques can already handle many problems in an automated way. I remain rational but also optimistic about the future of machine learning and AI.

During my machine learning adventure, I find that visualization plays a critical role in enhancing the intepretation. I began to learn [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) as the visualization tool for the data. As I dig deeper, it makes me also a self-taught web developer and successfully find a job intern in [tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/). Web development is cool because when you write code, you are actually produce something. The happiness is similar to a kid building toy blocks.

As a CS student, I am proficient in C++, python, javascript and bash scripts. I definitely love linux system. I have to find some time to read its kernel manual in the future ðŸ¤£ .

For music, I am really into the British singer Adele (I am listening her song the moment I am writing this). I play basketball and tennis. When I have time I do paintings as well. I have once considered to go to an art school (and received some training as well), but since I was pretty good in highschool coursework, I decided to go to a normal university and study the computer science. Hopefully I can post some of my works in the website in future.

That's so far I can tell about myself. If something interests you, don't hesitate to contact me by email, twitter or whatever.
