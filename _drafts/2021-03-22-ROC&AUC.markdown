# ROC & AUC


### ROC(Reveiver Operator Characteristic)
 

y-axis(sensitivity): The portion of correctedly classfied positives. (should be pos, predicted as pos)

  $$True \ Positive \ Rate = \dfrac{True Positives}{True Positives + False Negatives}$$

x-axis(1-specificity): The portion of wrongly classified negatives. (should be neg, predicted as pos)
$$False\ Positive\ Rate = \dfrac{False Positives}{False Positives + True Negatives}$$


### AUC(Area under the curve)

If area under the curve is greater, it means its a better ROC. Help identiy which method(curve) is better.
