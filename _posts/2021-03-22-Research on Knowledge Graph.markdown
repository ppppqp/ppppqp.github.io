# Knowledge Graph

[stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/~vinayc/kg/notes/What_is_a_Knowledge_Graph.html)

## Definition
A knowledge graph is a **directed labeled graph in which the labels have well-defined meanings**. A directed labeled graph consists of nodes, edges, and labels. Anything can act as a node, for example, people, company, computer, etc. An edge connects a pair of nodes and captures the relationship of interest between them, for example, friendship relationship between two people, customer relationship between a company and person, or a network connection between two computers. The labels capture the meaning of the relationship, for example, the friendship relationship between two people.

## Applications
There are numerous applications of knowledge graphs both in research and industry. Within computer science, there are many uses of a directed graph representation, for example, data flow graphs, binary decision diagrams, state charts, etc. For our discussion here, we have chosen to focus on two concrete applications that have led to recent surge in popularity of knowledge graphs: organizing information over internet and data integration.
