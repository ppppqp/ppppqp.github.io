# Background

When searching for academic papers, compared with simply matching keywords, researchers prefer to see the exact documents, scholars or academic conferences which are highly correlated in discussing topics and research areas with which they have read.

There are two main aspects to calculate entity(papers) similarity: **content and relationship**. Current research includes:

### Content-based work

|Method |Similarity Rep | Example
|--|--|--|
|convert documents into vectors | distance between vectors|BoW, VSM, word2vec
|SimHash algorithm to encode document | Hamming distance | SimHash
|extract topics from doc and get probability distribution of documents on topics |probability distribution |LSI, LDA, PLSA, sLDA

### Relation-based work

|Method |Similarity Rep | Example
|--|--|--|
|SimRank(similar to textRank) | | SimRank|
|model network as Markov-chain |distance |



### Put them together

|Method |Similarity Rep | Example
|--|--|--|
|improved topic model(allows each word to be drawn from reference) |probability distribution of reference papers | RefTM|


### Problems:
1. Only use either text informaiton or correlation between them, seldom putting two aspects together
2. Ignore the fact that the strength of relationships in network are different.(?)
3. No solution t measure similarity among different types of entities.



# Porposed Model: AgTM

So this is the proposed model: AgTM.

#### Originated from LDA but different
  
1. Allow each word to be drawn from not only the papers own topic, but from its references, authors and conference.
2. Introduced a similarity metric based on content and relation


### Model Description
#### 1. Knowledge Grpah
Entity types:
* Paper
* Author
* Conference
* Reference
* Written-by
* Published-in

#### 2. Topic Modeling
***AgTM can choose a topic from its own topic distribution, but also from the topic distribution of its references, authors and conference, as the topic of a word.***


Parameters:

* $s$ : 
  * topic source index $s\in{1,2,3,4}$
  * generated by a 4-dimension multinomial distribution parameter $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \lambda_{2}, \lambda_3, \lambda_4)$
  * indicate where the topic comes from
  * Follows a multinomial distribution.
* $\delta$: 
  * selection of the cited paper(strength of each cite)
  * follows multinomial distribution
* $\mu$:
  * selection of author
  * follows multinomial distribution
* $\theta$:
  * topic distribution for each sholar, conference, paper
  * follows a Dirichelet distribution $Dir(\alpha)$
* $\phi$: 
  * word distribution for each topic
  * follows a Dirichelet distribution $Dir(\beta)$


**Setup:**\
Suppose we have
* $M$ Paper nodes,
* $A$ Author nodes,
* $C$ Conference nodes
* $K$ topics expressed by $V$ words
* $L_m$ as the reference number of the paper $m\in M$
* $A_m$ as the author number of the paper $m\in M$


**Process:**
1. Generate word distribution $\phi_z$ for each topic $z$
2. Generate topic distribution $\theta_a$ for each sholar $a$
3. Generate topic distribution $\theta_c$ for each conference $c$
4. Generate topic distribution $\theta_m$, reference distribution $\mu_m$, topic source distribution $\lambda_m$ for each paper $m$
5. For each word $n$ in paper $m$
   1. Draw topic source index $s_{m,n}$ follows $Multi(\lambda_m)$
   2. Draw corresponding topic and word according to the source indicated by the source index.

#### 3. Parameter Esitmation

Gibbs Sampling (Omitted)

**Entity:**
* Paper
  * five largest topics in probability distribution on topic
* Mentor


**Relationship:**
* Written-by
* Talking about
