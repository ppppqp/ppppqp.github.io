AdaBoost(Adaptive Boosting) adjust the order of training with the result from the previous training epoach, so that the weak calssifier can perform better on the errors.


### Problem Setup

Consider a training set $T = {(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \cdots, (x_N,y_N)}$ where $x\in\mathbb{R^n}, y\in\{-1,+1\}$

### Training Process

The steps are listed as follows:

1. First epoach: Set all samples as equal-weight. $w_{1,i} = \dfrac{1}{N}$
2. In the $m$ epoach, find the model that yields the smallest error rate $F_m(x)$
   Use the equation for **error rate** $e_m = \underset{i=1}{\overset{N}\sum}w_{m,i}I(F_m(x_i)\neq y_i)$
   * Error rate is the sum of the weight of all wrongly predicted samples. $w_{m,i}$ is the weight of the $i$ sample in $m$ epoach
   * $I$ is the indicator function
3. Update the weight $\alpha_m$ for weak model $F_m$ with $\alpha_m = \dfrac{1}{2}\ln\dfrac{1-e_n}{e_m}$. We add $F_m$ to the strong model $f_m$ with $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + \alpha_m F_m(x)$
4. Update the weight for the data samples. $w_{m+1,i} = \dfrac{w_{m,i}}{Z_m}\exp{-\alpha_m y_i F_m (x_i)}$
    * $w_{m,i}$ is the previous weight for sample $i$
    * $Z$ is a normalize parameter, $Z_m = \underset{i=1}{\overset{N}{\sum}} w_{m,i}\exp{-\alpha_m y_i F_m(x_i)}$.
    * Intepretation: For correctly predicted samples, $-y_{i}F_m(x_i)<0$, which cause the weight to decay. The amount of decay is controlled by $\alpha_m$.

5. Iterate over so that the error rate threshold is reached. The final strong model is $sign[f_M(x)] = sign[\underset{i=1}{\overset{N}{\sum}}\alpha_i F_i(x)]$


### Regularization

To prevent the issue of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term $v$. The iteration process now becom $f_m(x) = f_{m-1}(x) + v\alpha_m F_m(x)$, $v\in(0,1]$. It controls how many weak classifier is needed to reach the same accuracy.


## Code Implementation
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
X =[[1,2], [3,4]]
Y = [1,0]
model = AdaBoostClassifier(random_state=123)
model.fit(X,y)
model.predict([[5,5]])
```
